    <p>Well done you have completed the Distance Learning component for Module One of the Vector Programme.</p>
    <p>To have got this far you have done extensive reading, a number of revision exercises and have completed a number of summative School Final assessments.</p>
    <p>The next step now is to complete your Module One Training Action Plan.  The purpose of this plan is to ensure that you are ready to take full advantage of the five day, module one onsite Consolidation Training.</p>
    <p>The Training Action Plan will be unique to your learning needs, the length of time to complete it may vary but once you have successfully completed that study plan we will book you on the next available Consolidation Training event.</p>

<p>Module consolidation periods will normally be conducted at the LEAL classroom facility in Oxford.  There is a minimum total of 74 training hours of Instructor led consolidation lessons and these are spread over 3 separate consolidation periods totalling 12 days (5, 3 and 4 days respectively).</p>
<p>Each consolidation day will comprise up to 7 hours of instructor led work and may include weekend programming as necessary.</p>
<p>The Module One Consolidation Programme will typically be five days onsite, with a total of 31 hours of learning. </p>
<p>The consolidation element can alternatively be delivered virtually, on-line, by the relevant instructor for those students who may not be able to travel.  However, the student must be available for the whole period to ensure that they get the full value out of the training and also to comply with the regulatory requirements.
